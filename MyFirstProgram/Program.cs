// A couple of things you need to know regarding C# code
/*
- A C# program has several layers to it and unlike Python, here it entails a lot
of typing just like C and Java.
- Variable names are defined explicitly.
- All program lines MUST end with a semicolon.
- There is this Main method that is the entry point of a C# program and immediately
after defining it, there are curly braces that contain the body of the main method.
- Everything that is created ontop of the Main methon will be executed when you run
the code and work down executing any code that follows.
- In order for any program to run, the Main method MUST be called.
- There is a Console.WriteLine method that displays whatever text you put into it
on a console display. As seen from the two examples above, when we run the program,
it will display Hello, World! and This is amazing! respectfully on the console. The
text being displayed on the console MUST be written in double quotes.
